# ARK Resolver Migration Plan - Phase 1

This document tracks the migration of Python code to Rust for the DSP ARK Resolver project.

## Phase 1 Overview

Phase 1 focuses on migrating core functions to Rust while maintaining Python compatibility. The convention is to create `_rust.py` files that run in parallel with Python implementations for production verification.

## Migration Status

### âœ… Completed
- [x] **Settings/Configuration System** - Fully migrated to Rust (`ArkUrlSettings`)
- [x] **Basic Rust Infrastructure** - PyO3 setup, build system, basic functions
- [x] **ARK URL Parsing** - Regex-based parsing moved to Rust
- [x] **Initial Test Coverage** - Parallel test files created
- [x] **Check Digit Migration** - Complete migration of `check_digit.py` to Rust with full test parity

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] **UUID Processing Functions** - Migrate `add_check_digit_and_escape()` and `unescape_and_validate_uuid()`

### ðŸ“‹ Planned (Phase 1)

#### High Priority
- [x] **Complete Check Digit Module Migration**
  - [x] Migrate `is_valid()` function to Rust
  - [x] Migrate `calculate_check_digit()` function to Rust  
  - [x] Migrate `calculate_modulus()` function to Rust
  - [x] Migrate helper functions (`weighted_value`, `to_int`, `to_check_digit`) to Rust
  - [x] Expose complete API to Python via PyO3
  - [x] Update `ark_url_rust.py` to use Rust check digit functions
  - [x] Add comprehensive Rust unit tests for check digit logic

- [ ] **UUID Processing Migration**
  - [ ] Implement `add_check_digit_and_escape()` in Rust
  - [ ] Implement `unescape_and_validate_uuid()` in Rust
  - [x] Remove TODO comments in `ark_url_rust.py:54` (completed - now uses Rust check digit functions)
  - [ ] Update Python code to use Rust implementations

#### Medium Priority  
- [ ] **ARK URL Formatter Migration**
  - [ ] Migrate `resource_iri_to_ark_id()` method to Rust
  - [ ] Migrate `resource_iri_to_ark_url()` method to Rust
  - [ ] Migrate `format_ark_url()` method to Rust
  - [ ] Create `ArkUrlFormatter` Rust struct with PyO3 bindings

- [ ] **ARK URL Info Processing Migration**
  - [ ] Migrate `ArkUrlInfo.__init__()` parsing logic to Rust
  - [ ] Migrate `to_redirect_url()` method to Rust
  - [ ] Migrate `to_resource_iri()` method to Rust
  - [ ] Migrate `to_dsp_redirect_url()` method to Rust

#### Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Expand Test Coverage**
  - [ ] Add comprehensive Rust unit tests for all migrated functions
  - [ ] Ensure test parity between Python and Rust implementations
  - [ ] Add integration tests for Python-Rust interop

- [ ] **Performance Validation**
  - [ ] Add benchmarking to measure Rust performance gains
  - [ ] Validate production parallel execution works correctly
  - [ ] Performance regression testing

#### Code Cleanup
- [ ] **Type Safety Improvements**
  - [ ] Address TODO in `ark_url.py:194` about ConfigParser types
  - [ ] Address TODO in `ark_url_rust.py:14` about Rust module typing
  - [ ] Improve error handling consistency

### ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria for Phase 1

- [ ] All core ARK URL processing functions have Rust implementations
- [ ] Python and Rust implementations run in parallel in production
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for both Python and Rust code
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show expected improvements
- [ ] No regressions in functionality
- [ ] All TODO comments related to Phase 1 migration are resolved

## Notes

- Each migration should maintain backward compatibility
- All changes must include corresponding test updates
- Performance should be measured before and after migration
- Code should follow existing Rust and Python conventions in the codebase

## Next Steps

1. Start with **Check Digit Module Migration** as it's self-contained and performance-critical
2. Complete **UUID Processing Functions** to remove existing TODOs
3. Expand **Test Coverage** to ensure reliability
4. Begin **ARK URL Formatter Migration** for the next major component
